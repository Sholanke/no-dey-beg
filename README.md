# No Dey Beg
A go at abeg.app's old web page.

# The challenge
The challenge was not to just re-create the web page, but to re-create it using nothing but vanilla HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. Notable parts of the code are the custom debouncer in the JS folder, keyframes animation in SCSS, and the for loops in the SCSS.
